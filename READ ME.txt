How to use:
Since your a little dope and will probably need help figuring out how to open this I've written a guide :)

1)download the dist.zip file from this repository

2)right click the file and click extract all(if your doing it on your Virtual machine) if your doing it on mac just double click the folder to decompress it

3)drag click the download onto your desktop from your file explorer for easier access (Optional)

4)whenever you want to use it double click the cases.exe (exe stands for executable it just makes it so you dont have to install python to run it)

5) after your terminal pops up for a couple seconds the program should run, Don't close the terminal ever (it'll close the program) just click the X at the top left of the program when your done with it
